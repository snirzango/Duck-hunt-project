in order to play the demo scene u need to copy paste projectsettings folder provided in the asset folder and overwrite your default ones.
or use the assets to build your own ;)

demoscene controls:

WASD to move
SPACE to jump
LEFT SHIFT to run
LEFT MOUSE to fire
RIGHT MOUSE to aim
MIDDLE MOUSE SCROLL to switch weapon
F action
G grenadetoss
C crouch/uncrouch
r to reload
t melee knife

(or use a XBOX controller)

press jump to enter a ladder from the bottom, when entering a ladder from top this is not necessary. 

make sure the rootcontroller of the prefabplayer is at 0x.0y.0z.



have fun!
